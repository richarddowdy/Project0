        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        

        <p>
                My name is Richard Dowdy and I’m originally from North Carolina. My childhood years were filled with
            athletics, like most other kids from this area. My favorite sport from an early age was basketball and I
            practiced tirelessly for years. My time and effort spent honing my skill was recognized and rewarded as I
            started looking for colleges. I was recruited to play for one of the best NCAA Division II teams in the
            country, where I was a scholarship athlete for all four years.
        </p>
        <p>
                After college, I briefly pursued personal training as a career and found this to be an insufficient way to
            earn a living. After some consideration I ended up putting myself through the Police Academy at a local
            Community College. I landed my first job in Law Enforcement with the Sheriff’s Office in the county where I
            grew up.
        </p>
        <p>
                I spent over four years working in the Patrol Division as a Sheriff’s Deputy. During my time in Law
            Enforcement I was honored to receive a Medal Of Valor for my participation in an event that happened within
            my first month of employment. Two years later I was awarded the Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) North
            Carolina Deputy of the Year in 2016 for my work in apprehending impaired motorists. In 2018 I was the
            youngest and least experienced Deputy to be promoted to the rank of Corporal. In this role I routinely acted
            as Assistant Supervisor and even was assigned as the Supervisor of the squad when the higher ranking
            officers were out of service or assigned elsewhere. My responsibilities also demanded that I act as Field
            Training Officer to officers who were new to the Patrol Division.
        </p>
        <p>
                While I was still employed full time I became infatuated with technology and learning how to code. I was
            amazed that computers could be instructed to complete nearly any task or be used to create applications that
            could literally change the world. I set off on a journey of self-education and loved every struggle and
            every break through. Without a mentor or a teacher of any kind I often ran into obstacles that forced me to
            learn how to research and read documentation. I dabbled in Python at first and understood the basics of the
            language and of coding in general. Next I moved on to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>    
                With my newly found powers of Web Development languages I started this website from scratch. I learned how
            to put together files in a way that the browser would be able to render them. I also learned about how to
            buy a domain and set it up with web hosting. All this was very exciting for me at first and it still is as I
            type this.
        </p>  
        <p>
                My goal is to continue pushing myself to learn more and also to create more. I would really love to make a
            website for my Dad’s tax business and also make him a website to consolidate all his favorite fishing
            reports and weather conditions from around the world so he can easily plan his next fishing vacation.
        </p>
